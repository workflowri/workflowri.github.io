### Community Research Infrastructure Survey

The purpose of this study is to better understand workflow 
**research** and **development** problem domains, requirements for 
**workflow management systems (WMS)**, capabilities and perceived 
limitations of current WMS, and opportunities for supporting 
and improving workflow and  WMS research and development 
activities. You are invited as a possible participant if 
you may have used or developed workflow management systems in 
the past for your research.
