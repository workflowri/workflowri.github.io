        The <strong>workflows<span class="RI">RI</span></strong> and
        <a href="http://exaworks.org" target="_blank"><strong>ExaWorks</strong></a>
        projects held a very productive <a href="/summits/community">Workflows Community Summit</a>
        in January. The focus was to identify broad challenges for the workflows community and
        to propose a vision for community activities to address these challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the first summit focused on establishing a high level vision, this second summit will explore
        <strong>technical approaches</strong> for realizing (part of) that vision. Consequently, we hope to engage
        participants who are actively involved in workflow system development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on the outcomes of the first summit, we have identified four technical topics for discussion (some align
        with a single theme of the first summit, while others are cross-cutting):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Definition and development of community workflow benchmarks;</li>
        <li>Definition of common workflow patterns (both for determining workflow system functionality and for providing
            users with tutorial examples);
        </li>
        <li>Identifying paths toward interoperability of workflow systems; and</li>
        <li>Improving workflow systems' interface with legacy and emerging HPC software and hardware stacks</li>
    </ol>
