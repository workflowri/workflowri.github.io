The <strong>workflows<span class="RI">RI</span></strong> and
[ExaWorks](http://exaworks.org) projects are organizing the
**Workflows Community Summit**.

This unique event will gather a selective group of lead researchers 
from distinct workflow management system efforts, in which we seek 
to identify areas of **need and open challenges** from the workflow 
community. This event will be the first of a series of focused meetings, 
and will be key for defining the strategic goals for these upcoming 
meetings with the science community and workflow developers.

_More information will be posted soon!_
